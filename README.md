# Traffic Signs Recognition
This code is an image detection task and the purpose is to detect traffic signs from the pictures we have. Detecting traffic signs is a capability that can be seen in Tesla cars.<br>
Keras, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Skimage libraries are used. <br>
Below is the model I have performed after image normalization, converting RGB to Grayscale, and increasing the contrast of the given data.<br>

Using this model, I have reached an accuracy of 96%.<br>
The two common image classes that were mistaken for each other are shown below. <br> <br>
